# Bellybutton Biodiversity Visualization

An experiment has been conducted to identify important bacteria present in the bellybuttons of various people.
The purpose of this data visualization is to provide a dashboard where participants of the experiment can 
check out the results of their own bellybutton swab. Participants will select their ID number from a drop down menu, 
which will update the bar, bubble, and gauge charts to highlight data gathered from the experiment.
